## Requirements

-   **SERVER**: Apache 2 or NGINX.
-   **RAM**: 3 GB or higher.
-   **PHP**: 7.4 or higher.
-   **For MySQL users**: 5.7.23 or higher.
-   **For MariaDB users**: 10.2.7 or Higher.
-   **Node**: 8.11.3 LTS or higher.
-   **Composer**: 1.6.5 or higher.

<br>

## Installation and Configuration

-   Find **.env** file in root directory and change the **APP_URL** param to your **domain**.

-   Also, Configure the **Mail** and **Database** parameters inside **.env** file.

```
php artisan leadbrowser:install
```

When you are done, remember to upload the database with countries, provinces and cities. Without this, the search will not work.

**To execute LeadBrowser**:

##### On server:

Warning: Before going into production mode we recommend you uninstall developer dependencies.
In order to do that, run the command below:

> composer install --no-dev

```
Open the specified entry point in your hosts file in your browser or make an entry in hosts file if not done.
```

##### On local:

```
php artisan route:clear
php artisan serve
```

##### Docker:

All docker commands are abstracted into [Makefile](./Makefile) instructions.

They are very simple and often just instead of the `docker-compose` command you need to write `make` in your terminal.

Of course, you can still use the `docker-compose` commands in the terminal, but you should remember that development and production environments rely on different docker-compose files. 

Example:
```
# Make command
make up

# Full command
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Because *make* commands are much easier to use than full docker-compose commands, I prefer and recommend using them, so free to explore them and edit according to your needs.

### Start containers

```bash
# Make command
make up

# Full command
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Now you can open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) URL in your browser.

### Stop containers

```bash
# Make command
make down

# Full command
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

### Bash aliases

Also, there is a set of [bash aliases](./aliases.sh) which you can apply using the command:

```bash
source aliases.sh
```

Now to run any artisan command you can use:

```bash
artisan make:model Product
```

### Logs

All laravel logs are forwarded to the docker log collector via the `stderr` channel.

See the latest logs, running the command:

```bash
docker-compose logs app
```

### Storage

To use the `public` disk of the Laravel storage system you need to create a symlink.

The symlink should be relative to work properly inside the docker environment and outside it at the same time.

First, you need to install `symfony/filesystem` package which allows generating relative symlinks.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app composer require symfony/filesystem --dev
```

Then create the symlink using the command:

```bash
# Make command
make storage:link

# Raw command
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app php artisan storage:link --relative
```

On production environment it will be created automatically.
