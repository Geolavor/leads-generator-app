## Getting Started

If you are using Snov.io or Hunter.io, with LeadBrowser you will be able to get better data on your own server for free! I'm a supporter of true democracy and decentralization, so I'm betting on transparency and I'm sure that our community will overtake all solutions present on the market. Create web3 with me!
